                <h2>the 1</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm doing good<br>
                    I'm on some new shit<br>
                    Been saying "yes" instead of "no"<br>
                    I thought I saw you at the bus stop<br>
                    I didn't though<br>
                    I hit the ground running each night<br>
                    I hit the Sunday matinée<br>
                    You know the greatest films of all time<br>
                    Were never made<br>
                    I guess you never know, never know<br>
                    And if you wanted me, you really should've showed<br>
                    And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow<br>
                    And it's alright now<br><br>

                    But we were something,<br>
                    Don't you think so?<br>
                    roaring twenties,<br>
                    Tossing pennies in the pool<br>
                    And if my wishes came true<br>
                    It would've been you<br>
                    In my defense<br>
                    I have none<br>
                    For never leaving well enough alone<br>
                    But it would've been fun<br>
                    If you would've been the one<br><br>

                    I had this dream<br>
                    You're doing cool shit<br>
                    Having adventures on your own<br>
                    You meet some woman on the internet<br>
                    And take her home<br>
                    We never painted by the numbers, baby<br>
                    But we were making it count<br>
                    You know the greatest loves of all time are over now<br>
                    I guess you never know, never know<br>
                    And it's another day waking up alone<br><br>

                    Chorus<br><br>

                    I persist and resist the temptation to ask you<br><br>

                    If one thing had been different<br>
                    Would everything be different today?<br><br>

                    We were something, don't you think so?<br>
                    Rosé flowing<br>
                    With your chosen family<br>
                    And it would've been sweet<br>
                    If it could've been me<br>
                    In my defense I have none<br>
                    For digging up the grave another time<br>
                    But it would've been fun<br>
                    If you would've been the one

                <h2>cardigan</h2>
                <p>
                    Vintage tee, brand new phone<br>
                    High heels on cobblestones<br>
                    When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
                    Sequin smile, black lipstick<br>
                    Sensual politics<br>
                    When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br><br>

                    But I knew you<br>
                    Dancin' in your Levi's<br>
                    Drunk under a streetlight<br>
                    I knew you<br>
                    Hand under my sweatshirt<br>
                    Baby, kiss it better<br>
                    And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under<br>
                    someone's bed<br>
                    You put me on and said I was your favorite<br><br>

                    A friend to all is a friend to none<br>
                    Chase two girls, lose the one<br>
                    When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br><br>

                    But I knew you<br>
                    Playing hide-and-seek and<br>
                    Giving me your weekends<br>
                    I knew you<br>
                    Your heartbeat on the High Line<br>
                    Once in twenty lifetimes<br>
                    And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under<br>
                    someone's bed<br>
                    You put me on and said I was your favorite<br><br>

                    To kiss in cars and downtown bars<br>
                    Was all we needed<br>
                    You drew stars around my scars<br>
                    But now I'm bleeding<br>

                    Cause I knew you<br>
                    Stepping on the last train<br>
                    Marked me like a bloodstain<br>
                    I knew you<br>
                    Tried to change the ending<br>
                    Peter loosing Wendy<br>
                    I knew you<br>
                    Leaving like a father<br>
                    Running like water<br>
                    When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
                    But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss<br>
                    I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs<br>
                    The smell of smoke would hang around this long<br>
                    Cause I knew everything when I was young<br>
                    I knew I'd curse you for the longest time<br>
                    Chasing shadows in the grocery line<br>
                    I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired<br>
                    And you'd be standin' in my front porch light<br>
                    And I knew you'd come back to me<br>
                    You'd come back to me<br>
                    And you'd come back to me<br>
                    And you'd come back<br><br>

                    And when I felt like I was an old cardigan<br>
                    Under someone's bed<br>
                    You put me on and said I was your favorite

                <h2>the last great american dynasty</h2>
                <p>
                    Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train<br>
                    It was sunny<br>
                    Her saltbox house on the coast<br>
                    Took her mind off St. Louis<br>
                    Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name<br>
                    And money<br>
                    And the town said<br>
                    "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"<br>
                    The wedding was charming<br>
                    If a little gauche<br>
                    There's only so far new money goes<br>
                    They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"<br>
                    Their parties were tasteful<br>
                    If a little loud<br>
                    The doctor had told him to settle down<br>
                    It must have been her fault his heart gave out<br><br>

                    And they said<br>
                    "There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
                    Who knows, if she never showed up<br>
                    what could've been<br>
                    There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen<br>
                    She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything"<br><br>

                    Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set<br>
                    Forever<br>
                    Flew in all her Bitch Packin' friends from the city<br>
                    Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names and blew<br>
                    through the money on the boys and the ballet<br>
                    And losing on card game bets with Dalí<br><br>

                    And they said<br>
                    "There goes the last great American dynasty"<br>
                    Who knows, if she never showed up<br>
                    what could've been<br>
                    There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen<br>
                    She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything<br><br>

                    They say<br>
                    She was seen on occasion<br>
                    Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea<br>
                    And in a feud with her neighbor she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green<br>
                    50 years is a long time<br>
                    Holiday House sat quietly on that beach<br>
                    Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits<br>
                    Then it was bought by me<br><br>

                    Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been<br>
                    There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen<br>
                    I had a marvelous time ruinin' everything<br>
                    I had a marvelous time<br>
                    Ruining everything<br>
                    A marvelous time<br>
                    Ruining everything<br>
                    A marvelous time<br>
                    I had a marvelous time

                    I want you to know<br>
                    I'm a mirrorball<br>
                    I'll show you every version of yourself tonight<br>
                    I'll get you out on the floor<br>
                    Shimmering beautiful<br>
                    And when I break it's in a million pieces<br><br>

                    Hush<br>
                    When no one is around, my dear<br>
                    You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes<br>
                    Spinning in my highest heels, love<br>
                    Shining just for you<br>
                    Hush<br>
                    I know they said the end is near<br>
                    But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes<br>
                    Spinning in my highest heels, love<br>
                    Shining just for you<br><br>

                    I want you to know<br>
                    I'm a mirrorball<br>
                    I can change everything about me to fit in<br>
                    You are not like the regulars<br>
                    The masquerade revelers<br>
                    Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten<br><br>

                    Chorus<br><br>

                    And they called off the circus<br>
                    Burned the disco down<br>
                    When they sent home the horses<br>
                    And the rodeo clowns<br>
                    I'm still on that tightrope<br>
                    I'm still trying everything<br>
                    to get you laughing at me<br>
                    I'm still a believer<br>
                    But I don't know why<br>
                    I've never been a natural<br>
                    All I do is try, try, try<br>
                    I'm still on that trapeze<br>
                    I'm still trying everything<br>
                    To keep you looking at me<br><br>

                    Because I'm a mirrorball<br>
                    I'm a mirrorball<br>
                    I'll show you every version of yourself<br>
                    Tonight

                <h2>invisible string</h2>
                <p>
                    Green was the color of the grass<br>
                    Where I used to read at Centennial Park<br>
                    I used to think I would meet somebody there<br>
                    Teal was the color of your shirt<br>
                    when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop<br>
                    You used to work at to make a little money<br><br>

                    Time<br>
                    Curious time<br>
                    Gave me no compasses<br>
                    Gave me no signs<br>
                    Were there clues I didn't see?<br>
                    And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
                    All along there was some<br>
                    Invisible string<br>
                    Tying you to me<br><br>

                    Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA<br>
                    You ate at my favorite spot for dinner<br>
                    Bold was the waitress on our three year trip getting<br>
                    lunch down by the Lakes<br>
                    She said I looked like an American singer<br><br>

                    Time<br>
                    Mystical time<br>
                    Cutting me open, then healing me fine<br>
                    Were there clues I didn't see?<br>
                    And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
                    All along there was some<br>
                    Invisible string<br>
                    Tying you to me<br><br>

                    A string that pulled me out<br>
                    of all the wrong arms<br>
                    right into that dive bar<br>
                    Something wrapped all of my<br>
                    past mistakes in barbed wire<br>
                    Chains around my demons<br>
                    Wool to brave the seasons<br>
                    One single thread of gold tied me to you<br><br>

                    Cold was the steel of my axe to grind<br>
                    For the boys who broke my heart<br>
                    Now I send their babies presents<br>
                    Gold was the color of the leaves when I<br>
                    showed you around Centennial Park<br>
                    Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven<br><br>

                    Time<br>
                    Wondrous time<br>
                    Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies<br>
                    And it's cool<br>
                    Baby with me<br>
                    And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
                    All along there was some<br>
                    Invisible string<br>
                    Tying you to me?
